# NX 2506
# Author:  br435t
# Created: 2026-10-20
# Colors every body in the displayed assembly according to its NX physical
# material, like color_by_material.py, but when it meets a body with NO material it
# prompts you to pick one from the material library, assigns it, and then colors the
# body with that material's color.
#
# Run via File -> Execute -> NX Open... with an assembly displayed.
#
# The dialog has a Search box: type part of a material name (words in any order, e.g.
# "alum 60") and press Enter to narrow the list; clear it to see every material.
# One dialog per body without a material (Cancel skips that body; the "Stop asking"
# toggle skips all the rest; the "CANCEL THE WHOLE OPERATION" toggle stops the run, keeping
# what was already done). The body being asked about is highlighted in the graphics
# window while the dialog is open (no zoom; your view is left alone). A skipped body gets the no-material color, as in
# color_by_material.py. Assembly-level color overrides on components are cleared
# first, also as in color_by_material.py.
#
# This MODIFIES the component parts: both the material assignment and the color are
# left unsaved. See README.md in this folder, and lib/color_by_material.py for the
# implementation.
