# Handoff — NX Open "Create Part" automation

Automates creating a McMaster-Carr COTS part in **NX 2506** running in
**Teamcenter managed mode**: enter a part number, scrape its data + CAD, and
create the `BE9_COTS` item with the imported geometry.

## Environment

- **NX 2506**, Python (CPython) journals run via **File → Execute → NX Open…**.
- Runs in **Teamcenter managed mode** (not native/filesystem mode). This changes
  everything about how parts are created (see gotchas).
- Custom Helion item types: `BE9_Design, BE9_Electrical, BE9_COTS, BE9_Tooling`
  (the part is created as `BE9_COTS`).
- Default template: `@DB/model-plain-1-inch-template/A` (units = inches).
- An `nxopen` MCP server (shipped as `NX_Open_MCP.zip`; `setup.bat` extracts it to
  the git-ignored `MCP/` and writes `.mcp.json` via `setup_mcp.ps1`) indexes the NX 2506 Python API and
  stubs — use it to look up signatures. **Note:** it does **not** index
  `NXOpen.UF` (that subsystem has no stubs on disk).

## Repository layout

Organized by where the code runs:

- **`NX-Scripts/`** — scripts executed **inside NX** (File → Execute → NX Open…).
- **`lib/`** — shared helpers the NX scripts import. `lib/scraper/` is external
  code run **outside NX** as a subprocess.
- **`example_journals/`** — journals **recorded in NX** (Tools → Journal →
  Record), kept as reference for reverse-engineering NX Open calls. Not run
  directly. **Git-ignored (local only)**, so it is not in a clone or a release.
- **Repo root** — `setup.bat`, `requirements.txt`, `.venv/` (git-ignored), and
  the docs.

An NX script finds the repo root by walking up, so it locates `lib/` and
`.venv/` no matter how deep it sits under `NX-Scripts/`.

### Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `NX-Scripts/Create-McMaster-Part/CREATE_MCMASTER_PART.py` | **Main tool.** Scraper-driven COTS flow: prompt for a part number → scrape JSON + download CAD → derive attributes → prompt for part name → create the `BE9_COTS` part → import the CAD. |
| `NX-Scripts/Create-McMaster-Part/CREATE_MCMASTER_PART_partno_dialog.dlx` | Single-field "Part Number" dialog (block id `partNo`) — step 1. |
| `NX-Scripts/Create-McMaster-Part/CREATE_MCMASTER_PART_partname_dialog.dlx` | Single-field "Part Name" dialog (block id `partName`) — prefilled with the description; sets `DB_PART_NAME`. |
| `NX-Scripts/Check-Part-Exists/check_part_exists.py` | Standalone diagnostic: checks whether an item id already exists in Teamcenter by trying `GetConfiguredRevisionOfItems` across several revision rules and printing which resolve it. Used to find the working rules for the main tool's pre-check. |
| `lib/scraper/` | Vendored copy of the McMaster-Carr scraper (`br435t/McMaster-scraper`). See `lib/scraper/VENDORED.md`. Run as a subprocess, not imported into NX. |
| `example_journals/journal_create_vendor_part.py` | Fresh **working** recording of the COTS create (creates `ID.A/Name`). Source of truth for the required attributes; `lib/vendor_part.py::create_vendor_part` is built from it. |
| `example_journals/journal_import_Parasolid.py` | Recorded File → Import → Parasolid journal the `import_parasolid()` helper was derived from. |
| `NX_Open_MCP.zip` / `MCP/` / `.mcp.json` | NX Open API MCP server: zip is committed; `setup.bat` extracts it to `MCP/` and writes `.mcp.json` (both git-ignored) pointing at `.venv` python. |

## COTS / vendor parts (`CREATE_MCMASTER_PART.py`)

Creates a `BE9_COTS` item. Differs from the Design flow in three ways:

- **Item type** is `BE9_COTS` (not `BE9_Design`).
- **Part number is user-supplied** (the vendor/manufacturer PN), written as the
  `DB_PART_NO` attribute — *not* auto-assigned from a naming pattern.
- **Attributes span two categories:** `DB_PART_NO`/`DB_PART_NAME` on `BE9_COTS`;
  `HE_Manufacturer`/`Item:revision:ItemRevision:be9_PartClass`/`DB_PART_REV` on
  `BE9_COTSRevision`. (`DB_PART_DESC` is no longer set.) The revision is `"NC"`
  (`_PART_REVISION` in the script; recording
  `example_journals/journal_create_vendor_part_with_NC_rev.py`), so the part is
  `<id>.NC` instead of `<id>.A`. `DB_PART_REV` is set *before* the naming-map
  step, as in that recording.

### Flow (`main()`)

This is the recorded journal wired to the scraper. `main()` does:

1. **Prompt for a part number** (`CREATE_MCMASTER_PART_partno_dialog.dlx`).
1b. **Existence pre-check** (`find_item_revision_spec`) — if the id already exists
   in Teamcenter, stop before the scrape and **open the existing part**
   (`open_teamcenter_part` → `Parts.OpenActiveDisplay(spec, AllowAdditional)`,
   using the `ItemRevisionCliSpec` the check returned). If it can't be opened, an
   error box is shown. Nothing is created or scraped. See gotcha #9.
2. **`fetch_mcmaster(pn)`** — subprocess to the external scraper: `scrape --out
   C:\TEMP\MCMASTER` (writes `<pn>.json`) then `cad --out C:\TEMP\MCMASTER
   --json` (downloads the default 3-D Parasolid, **no-threads** `*.X_T`).
2b. **No-CAD prompt** — if no `*.X_T` was downloaded (part has no 3-D model, e.g.
   `5887K51`; no no-threads Parasolid variant; download failed), show the reason
   and ask (`ask_yes_no`, `lib/nx_dialogs.py`) whether to create the part
   **without geometry**. **No** aborts before anything is created; **Yes**
   continues with `cad_file = None` and step 6 is skipped. (An empty part has to
   be deleted by hand if it wasn't wanted, hence the prompt.)
3. **Derive attributes:** `part_no` = scraped `part_number`; the default part
   name = `build_description()` = `title_primary` + `title_secondary`, concatenated and
   **UPPERCASED**; `HE_Manufacturer` = `"MCMASTER"`; `Part Class` = `"Class III"`.
4. **Prompt for the part name** (`CREATE_MCMASTER_PART_partname_dialog.dlx`), prefilled
   with the description as an editable default → `DB_PART_NAME`.
5. **`create_vendor_part()`** (`lib/vendor_part.py`) creates the `BE9_COTS` part
   in `:MCMASTER` (empty naming map, `DB_PART_NO` as an attribute).
   Mapping: ID → `DB_PART_NO`, Name → `DB_PART_NAME`, Manufacturer →
   `HE_Manufacturer`, Part Class → `be9_PartClass`, Revision → `DB_PART_REV`
   (`"NC"`).
6. **Import the downloaded Parasolid** (`import_parasolid()`) into the newly
   created work part — using the actual `*.X_T` path from step 2. Import happens
   after `Commit()` because the part must exist first. Skipped when the user chose
   to continue without CAD in step 2b.

Notes: a scrape failure aborts (the description depends on it); a missing CAD file prompts
(step 2b). Output dir is `C:\TEMP\MCMASTER`
(constant `MCMASTER_OUT`). Auto-login is left enabled, so an expired session
pops a sign-in window. The full flow (dialogs, existence pre-check, create, and
Parasolid import) is verified end to end in NX on a fresh part.

### McMaster scraper integration

`CREATE_MCMASTER_PART.py` shells out to the vendored `lib/scraper/mcmaster_scraper.py`
to fetch property data by part number. **It runs the scraper as a subprocess in
an external Python interpreter**, because the scraper needs Selenium + a real
Edge browser, which are not available in NX's embedded Python.

- Interpreter selection (`scraper_python()` in `lib/mcmaster.py`): `MCMASTER_SCRAPER_PYTHON` env var
  → the repo-root `.venv` (found by walking up from the script) → `python` on
  PATH. No env var needed if `.venv` exists — the script auto-detects it.
- Setup (once): run `setup.bat` at the repo root (creates `.venv`, installs
  `requirements.txt` behind the corporate proxy, and runs the
  McMaster `login` to cache the session).
- `fetch_mcmaster()` returns a dict with `data` / `json_file` / `cad_file` and
  `error` / `cad_error`; it never raises. Either error aborts creation: the
  scrape supplies the description, and a part with no CAD has nothing to import.
  Note the scraper writes its `cad --json` errors to **stdout**, not stderr, so
  `_cad_failure_reason()` reads stdout first to get a usable message
  (e.g. "no 'parasolid' (no threads) option for this part") instead of a bare
  exit code.

## How to run

1. One-time setup: run `setup.bat` at the repo root (creates `.venv`, installs
   `requirements.txt`, and caches the McMaster login).
2. Open NX 2506 with a Teamcenter session active.
3. **File → Execute → NX Open…** → select
   `NX-Scripts/Create-McMaster-Part/CREATE_MCMASTER_PART.py`.
4. Enter the McMaster part number. The tool scrapes the data, downloads the CAD,
   prompts for the part name, creates the `BE9_COTS` part, and imports the CAD;
   progress is logged to the Listing Window.

## Gotchas discovered (hard-won — don't re-learn these)

1. **Managed vs native mode.** In Teamcenter mode you must drive creation through
   `theSession.PdmSession.CreateCreateOperationBuilder(...)` →
   `PDM.PartOperationCreateBuilder`. A plain `FileNew.Commit()` (native path) fails
   with "The selected template doesn't exist".
2. **Template ref format:** `@DB/<template>/<rev>`, e.g. `@DB/model-plain-1-inch-template/A`.
3. **`FileNew.UsesMasterModel` is a string** (`"No"`/`"Yes"`), not a bool.
4. **Explicit subpackage imports:** `import NXOpen` does not pull in subpackages —
   need `import NXOpen.PDM`, `import NXOpen.BlockStyler`, etc.
5. **Destination folder** comes from `theSession.PdmSession.GetUserName()` — don't
   hardcode the user.
6. **UF `AskStringInput` is a trap** (this is why we moved to BlockStyler):
   - Its `str` arg is a **ref buffer** that must be exactly **133 chars**
     (`" " * 133`); `""` returns empty regardless of input.
   - It needs `Ui.LockUgAccess(UF_UI_FROM_CUSTOM)` / `UnlockUgAccess` around it or
     no dialog appears.
   - Its `cue` shows in the **status/cue line**, never inside the box.
7. **BlockStyler dialogs require callbacks** registered before `Show()`, or NX
   raises "The Initialize callback is not registered in automation code". Register
   `AddInitializeHandler`, `AddUpdateHandler` (cb takes a `block` arg, returns 0),
   `AddOkHandler`, `AddApplyHandler`. Read block values **inside** the OK/Apply
   callback, not after `Show()`.
8. The `.dlx` was hand-built from NX's own sample
   `C:\SPLM\NX\NX2506\MACH\auxiliary\sme\setLicense.dlx` to guarantee a valid schema.
9. **A duplicate item id is the *real* cause of "The new filename is not a valid
   file specification" at `Commit()`.** The message is a red herring — it is NOT
   about illegal filename characters (`/`, `"`) or the create call sequence.
   `GetOperationFailures()` after `ValidateLogicalObjectsToCommit()` reveals the
   truth: operation-failure **code 940519**, *"Cannot create a new revision of an
   existing part using New. Use Save As for this operation."* The item already
   exists in Teamcenter.
   - **Pre-check:** `find_item_revision_spec()` (`item_exists_in_teamcenter()` is a
     True/False wrapper) uses
     `PdmSession.GetConfiguredRevisionOfItems` to resolve the id *before*
     creating. This needs a **revision rule**: an empty rule resolves nothing
     (false "not found"). The rules that work here are **`Latest Working`** and
     **`Any Status; Working`**; `Latest Released` / `Precise` / `Latest` / empty
     do **not** (verified via `check_part_exists.py`). The check returns the spec
     of the first rule that resolves the id (`Latest Working` first, so the latest
     working revision is the one opened).
   - **Reading the failure:** `ErrorMessageHandler.GetErrorMessages()` returns
     NULL for these PDM builders; use `GetOperationFailures()` →
     `NXOpen.ErrorList` → `GetErrorInfo(i)` → `.ErrorCode` / `.Description`
     instead. `dump_pdm_errors()` in `lib/teamcenter.py` wraps this.
10. **BlockStyler string fields re-show the previous run's text (even after an NX
   restart).** The Part Number dialog opened with the last Part Name
   pre-fill (a product description) in its field instead of blank. Both `.dlx`
   dialogs share the title "Create Vendor Part", and NX restores saved field
   values **after** the initialize callback runs, so clearing only in
   `AddInitializeHandler` did **not** stick. What was tried:
   - Setting the string block's `RetainValue` property to `False` in both `.dlx`
     files: kept (it made the part-name dialog open empty before its pre-fill),
     but alone it was **not enough** for the Part Number field.
   - Clearing/setting `Value` + `WideValue` in the initialize callback: not enough.
   - **Fix that works:** also reset the field in an **`AddDialogShownHandler`**
     callback, which fires once the dialog is on screen, after NX has restored
     values. `prompt_string()` in `lib/nx_dialogs.py` calls the same `_reset()`
     (set `default`, or `""`) from both callbacks.
   - Diagnosing it needed before/after logging of `GetString("Value")` /
     `("WideValue")` at each callback; that logging has since been removed.
11. **Restart NX after editing anything under `lib/`.** NX's embedded Python keeps
   imported modules for the whole NX session, so a changed `lib/*.py` file is not
   re-read on the next *File → Execute → NX Open…* run — the old code keeps
   running. Seen when setting the part revision to `NC`: the updated
   `create_vendor_part(..., revision="NC")` still produced revision `A` until NX was
   restarted, then worked. The script file you select in the Execute dialog is
   re-read each run; the `lib` modules it imports are the cached part. The same
   applies to `.dlx` edits (see #10). **Rule: edit `lib/` or a `.dlx` → restart NX
   before testing**, and don't conclude a fix failed until you have.

## Status / open items

- **Verified end to end in NX:** prompt flow, existence pre-check, Teamcenter
  `BE9_COTS` creation, and Parasolid import all confirmed on a fresh part.
  Creating an id that already exists is now caught up front (gotcha #9) instead
  of failing cryptically at `Commit()`.
- The `.dlx` dialogs were authored by hand and haven't been round-tripped through
  Block UI Styler, but load and work in practice.
- The created part is not explicitly **saved to Teamcenter** after `Commit()` (the
  recorded journal didn't either). If a DB save is needed, add it.
- `part_class` is fixed at `"Class III"` — make it a dialog field if it should vary.
- **COTS flow:** the scraper is wired for **log-only**. Next step (when ready) is
  to map scraped fields onto attributes (e.g. title → `DB_PART_NAME`, secondary/
  specs, `HE_Manufacturer` → `McMaster-Carr`) and optionally
  write each spec as its own NX user attribute.
- **COTS dialogs (`.dlx`)** are hand-authored and not round-tripped through NX's
  Block UI Styler.
- `Part Class` is fixed at `"Class III"`; make it a dialog field if it needs to
  vary.
