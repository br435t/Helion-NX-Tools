# Helion NX Tools

NX Open (Python) automation and supporting tools for **NX 2506** running in\
**Teamcenter managed mode** at Helion.

The repo is organized by **where the code runs** — inside NX, outside NX, or\
recorded from NX as reference.

| [NX-Scripts/](NX-Scripts/) | Inside NX (File → Execute → NX Open…)  | The tools NX operators actually run, each in its own folder alongside its `.dlx` BlockStyler dialogs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [my_scripts/](my_scripts/) | Inside NX                              | Personal scripts. Every `*.py` here is git-ignored, so nothing you write in this folder is shared or committed. Put shared tools under `NX-Scripts/` instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Materials/](Materials/) | Not executed                           | Material library XMLs from the NX common library, plus `NX_Materials.csv` (one row per material; the `color` column is hand-maintained and drives Color-By-Material). `build_nx_materials_csv.py` rebuilds the CSV and keeps the colors.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [lib/](lib/)      | Inside NX (imported by the NX scripts) | Helpers the NX scripts call: `mcmaster.py` (scraper wrapper, description/filename helpers), `teamcenter.py` (existence check, PDM error dump, Parasolid import), `vendor_part.py` (`create_vendor_part`, the BE9_COTS create), `nx_dialogs.py` (BlockStyler prompts), `layers.py` (`move_to_layer`), and `scraper/` (the Selenium scraper, run as an external subprocess since NX's embedded Python can't drive Edge). Scripts keep only the user-facing flow. |
| [Windows-Tools/](Windows-Tools/) | Outside NX (run directly in Windows)   | Standalone troubleshooting utilities for the NX / Teamcenter workstation. They don't use the `.venv` or the NX Open scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `example_journals/` (git-ignored) | Not executed                           | Your recorded journals (Tools → Journal → Record), kept for reverse-engineering NX Open calls. One local-only folder at the repo root, also where personal journals go; it is not committed or shipped in releases, so create it if it is missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

An NX script locates the repo root (the folder containing `lib/`) by walking up\
the folder tree and adds it to `sys.path`, so it finds `lib/` and\
`.venv/` no matter how deep it sits under `NX-Scripts/`.

## Tools

- **[Create McMaster Part](NX-Scripts/Create-McMaster-Part/README.md)** — enter a\
  McMaster-Carr part number; it scrapes the product data, downloads the CAD,\
  creates a `BE9_COTS` part in Teamcenter, and imports the geometry. See its\
  [README](NX-Scripts/Create-McMaster-Part/README.md) for setup and usage.
- **[List Assembly Components](NX-Scripts/List-Assembly-Components/list_assembly_components.py)** —\
  walks the displayed assembly and writes every component, its bodies and their\
  NX material to `output/<part>_components.txt`, with a quantity-by-part summary.
- **[Color By Material](NX-Scripts/Color-By-Material/README.md)** — colors every\
  body by its NX material using the hex codes in `Materials/NX_Materials.csv`.\
  `color_by_material.py` clears assembly color overrides first;\
  `color_by_material_asm_leave_color.py` leaves them. `assign_and_color_materials.py`\
  also prompts for a material for each body that has none, assigns it, then colors it.\
  Modifies the component parts (not saved automatically).
- **[Assign Material](NX-Scripts/Assign-Material/README.md)** — assigns one material from the library
  (search box + list dialog) to the bodies you select in the current part, replacing any material they
  already have, colors them to match and updates the part's mass properties. Highlights the bodies; one undo step; nothing saved.
- **[Export Body DXF](NX-Scripts/Export-Body-DXF/README.md)** — for each solid body of the part, saves a view square-on
  to its largest flat face (`DXF_<BODYNAME>`, zoomed to fit) and exports the body to
  `output/<partID>_<revision>_<bodyname>.dxf` with all edges shown. `export_body_dxf_TC.py` also creates a
  Teamcenter dataset per body.
- **[Env Probe](NX-Scripts/Env-Probe/README.md)** — diagnostic that prints what NX sees\
  when it runs a script (script folder, `UGII_*` variables, `PYTHONPATH`, `sys.path`) to\
  trace the "Unable to append module directory path in PYTHONPATH" warning.
- **[Export System Log](NX-Scripts/Export-System-Log/README.md)** — copies the running\
  NX session's system log to `output/nx_syslog_<timestamp>.txt`, ready to attach to a\
  ticket or send to support.

## Windows Tools

- **[NX-TC-Cache-Clear](Windows-Tools/NX-TC-Cache-Clear/README.md)** — batch\
  script that stops NX and Teamcenter and clears their local caches when either\
  is misbehaving.
- **[Check-Environment-Variables](Windows-Tools/Check-Environment-Variables/README.md)** —\
  PowerShell script that tests the Windows User and System environment variables\
  (missing paths, bad `%VAR%` references, PATH problems, User/System conflicts,\
  write test) and saves a report. Double-click `Run-Check.bat`.
- **[Check-UGII-PythonPath](Windows-Tools/Check-UGII-PythonPath/README.md)** —\
  diagnoses the NX "Unable to append module directory path in PYTHONPATH" warning.

## Getting started

1. Clone (or extract) this repo to a **short, plain folder**, e.g.\
   `C:\Code\Helion-NX-Tools`. Avoid OneDrive, network drives, and paths with\
   spaces or special characters — NX can fail with *"Unable to append module\
   directory path in PYTHONPATH"* when a script is run from such a folder.\
   `setup.bat` warns if the folder looks risky.
2. **Double-click** [setup.bat](setup.bat) — creates `.venv`, installs\
   dependencies (behind the corporate SSL proxy), extracts the NX Open MCP\
   server (`NX_Open_MCP.zip` → `MCP/`, registered in `.mcp.json`), and caches the\
   McMaster login. Restart Claude Code in this folder afterwards so the `nxopen`\
   server loads.
3. Follow the per-tool README under [NX-Scripts/](NX-Scripts/) to run a tool.
4. Put your own scripts in [my_scripts/](my_scripts/) — they are git-ignored.

## Updating to a newer release

Double-click **`update.bat`** in this folder. It uses only what Windows already has (PowerShell), no
Python and no git, and needs internet access to github.com.

1. It lists the GitHub releases, newest first, for example `v1.0.0 Release` or `v0.9.5 Public Beta`, with the
   tag, the date, a *pre-release* flag, and which one you have installed. Type a number (Enter = the newest)
   or `Q` to quit.
2. It shows where the **backup** will go, asks you to confirm, then downloads the release (about 55 MB).
3. It saves your **current copy of every file it is about to overwrite** to a zip in `C:\Temp`, named like
   `Helion-NX-Tools_backup_v0.9.5_to_v1.0.0_20261023-133642.zip`. **The path is printed before the update
   and again at the end.** If the backup cannot be made, nothing is changed. Move the zip somewhere safe
   if you want to keep it, because `C:\Temp` is not kept forever.
4. It overwrites the files. Only files tracked in git are in a release, so anything git-ignored (`.venv`,
   `output`, `my_scripts\*.py`, `MCP`, `.mcp.json`, caches) is never downloaded or touched, and **nothing is
   ever deleted**.

Afterwards **restart NX** (it keeps the old modules in memory), and run `setup.bat` again if the update says
`requirements.txt` changed.

**To undo an update**, open PowerShell and run the `Expand-Archive` line written inside the backup zip
(`_BACKUP_INFO.txt`); it puts your old copies of those files back.

Good to know:

* **Your edits to tracked files are overwritten** (the backup is how you get them back). Keep your own work in
  `my_scripts\`, which an update never touches.
* **`update.bat` is only in releases made after it was added.** If your folder came from an older release,
  download `update.bat` and `update.ps1` once from the repository's main branch, put them in this folder, and
  run `update.bat`.
* A **git clone** should use `git pull` instead; `update.bat` warns and asks before it touches a clone.
* For scripting: `update.bat -Tag v1.0.0 -Yes` (no questions), `update.bat -DryRun` (show what would change),
  `-BackupDir D:\Backups` (a different backup folder).

## Using an AI assistant

The tools themselves are plain Python, batch and PowerShell files and need no assistant: run\
them as described in each tool's README. The repo's rules for an AI assistant (script headers,\
the `my_scripts/` conventions, how materials are loaded) are written in\
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), which **Claude Code** reads automatically.

### Using OpenAI Codex instead (UNTESTED)

> **Untested.** Nobody has tried this with this repo. It is based on a web search of\
> secondary write-ups (not OpenAI's own documentation), so check OpenAI's Codex\
> configuration reference before relying on any detail below, and expect to adjust it.

Codex reads a file called `AGENTS.md`, **not** `CLAUDE.md`, so it ignores this repo's rules\
unless you give them to it. Two ways:

**A. Per user, no repo change.** In your Codex config file (`~/.codex/config.toml`, i.e.\
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` on Windows) tell Codex to fall back to `CLAUDE.md`\
when a folder has no `AGENTS.md`:

```toml
project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]
```

Each person has to do this on their own machine. Start Codex from the repo folder.

Things to know:

- Codex limits how much instruction text it loads (reported as 32 KiB by default). `CLAUDE.md`\
  is well under that.
- `CLAUDE.md` mentions Claude-specific things (skills, a memory folder). Codex treats them as\
  plain text and cannot use them.
- **Not covered here (also untested):** the repo's `nxopen` MCP server (`.mcp.json`, `MCP/`)\
  and the `.claude/skills/` skill are Claude Code features. Whether Codex can use the MCP\
  server has not been checked.
